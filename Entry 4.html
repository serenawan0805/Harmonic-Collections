    <h1>Improbable Serenity</h1>
    <time>-Martin Klimas</time>
    <h5>"Flawlessly arranged flower vases are shot by steel bullets and captured at the moment of their destruction. When hit by the projectiles, glass vases shatter, and ceramic and stoneware vases burst into large fragments. What interests Klimas is not so much the moment of impact, but the transformation taking place in one seven-thousandth of a second. While the top half of the photograph remains poised in an absolutely harmonious still life, utter chaos has erupted below. The contrast of motionlessness and top speed explodes the triteness of the subject. The simultaneous presence of two distinct states and the improbable serenity of the pictures are positively spellbinding."</h5>

    <h4>A few quotes from Martin Klimas in relation to his works...</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>"To catch something out of the flow of time, to find the perfect moment is what photographers are ever looking for."</li>
        <li>"Because scientific photographic sets often gave a view to hidden imagery. I only try to make these images better and bring in an interesting context."</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>A few words from Gregory Jansen in relation to Klimas' work...</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>"The ancient motivation of the human eye and spirit of research is curiosity: to explore everything and make it visible, even the most hidden corners. But the human eye does not reach everywhere. Modern photography can help broaden horizons here, as this image shows. It documents the moment when a projectile penetrates an object, enters a body and destroys it. An ultra brief moment and invisible to the lazy human eye. The high-speed photography alone captures the tiny moment when the flower vase shatters and the water squirts aside, while the plant still remains in its upright position.</li>
        <li>We know vases of this kind from everyday life, as do the flowers in them, and we enjoy them. We also know the invisible bullet, but it has nothing positive. View and knowledge thus oscillate between floral splendor and explosion, between natural beauty and destruction. Objectively, we witness a process that, in its brutal dynamics, creates the invisible beauty of a moment that cannot be grasped by the human eye alone.</li>
        <li>Something had to be given up for this, because a photo is literally being shot - with light, against the vanitas, for the duration. Here, Klimas symbolically presents nature in full, self-confident splendor. It still resists being destroyed before it too perishes. The picture is thus not only a technical masterpiece, but also a warning: the destruction of creation may be underway long before the eye and intellect even perceive it."</li>
    </ul>
